# Basic-Python
# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and a
nswer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
